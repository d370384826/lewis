What the program ~~is going to do and how~~ does, because we never bothered to finish it.

  # ~~Input a compound (MgO2, NaCl, NH2CONH2, etc)~~
  # ~~<program> ionic or covalent?~~
  # <program> figure out what the bonds look like
  # <program> output a string in a notation for the bonds

We also have an notation2image parser

  # Input the notation
  # <program>Generates an image of a lewis diagram (png, ~~p?m~~)

The program will have both aspects linked.
